# Url Shortner

## Description
The Advanced URL Shortener project is a powerful web service built using Node.js that provides users with the ability to create short url, easy-to-share links for their long URLs. This project leverages the capabilities of MongoDB for persistent data storage and Redis for efficient caching, resulting in a highly performant and scalable system.

### Key Features

- URL Shortening: The project offers a user-friendly API with two main endpoints.

- URL Redirection: Users who access a short URL are automatically redirected to the original, longer URL.

- MongoDB Data Storage: The project employs MongoDB to store the mapping between the short codes and the corresponding original URLs.

- Redis Caching: To optimize performance I have utilized Redis as a caching layer. When users access a short URL, the corresponding original URL is fetched from the Redis cache, if available. This reduces the load on the MongoDB database and improves response times. I have also Implemented an expiration mechanism, automatically clearing outdated cache entries after 24 hours.
